# PinephonePogoBreakout

A breakout board for the Pinephone's expansion port, which consists of 6 pogo pins connected to I2C (SDA and SCL), the battery (at 3.8V), a 3.3V power rail (or is it 5V? Not confirmed yet), an interrupt pin, and GND.


I will go back and update the silkscreen to indicate which I2C pin is which, once I find out myself.
