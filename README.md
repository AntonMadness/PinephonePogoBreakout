# PinephonePogoBreakout

A breakout board for the Pinephone's expansion port, which consists of 6 pogo pins connected to I2C (SDA and SCL), the battery (at ~3.8V, powered even when device is off), a 5V/500mA power rail (which is powered from and only when USB in plugged in), an interrupt pin, and GND.

I will go back and update the silkscreen layer to indicate which I2C pin is which, once I find out myself.

Also the standoff/washer .stl file is for 3d printing; it's used because I left the three holes in the pcb larger than necessary to allow some wiggle room, and the machine screw (which is M1.4 by the way) will slip through it otherwise.
